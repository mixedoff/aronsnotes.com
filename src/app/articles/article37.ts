<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="article">self-ware is a book that serves as a manual for carbon-based algorithms (humans) to rebuild their broken world models and identities. This work addresses the fundamental challenge of understanding and reconstructing who we are.</p>

<h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
<p class="article"><strong>Vision:</strong> Not sure...</p>
<p class="article"><strong>Mission:</strong> Democratize stable self-ware.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<p class="article">Good old fashioned pen and paper, Angular, Hetzner Cloud, Nginx</p>

<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
<p class="article">This project represents a deep dive into the philosophical and practical aspects of identity formation and world model construction. The book explores how humans (carbon-based algorithms) can systematically rebuild their understanding of themselves and the world around them.</p>

<p class="article">The work combines insights from psychology, philosophy, and personal development to create a practical manual for those seeking to reconstruct their broken identity and worldview. It addresses the challenges many face when their existing models break down or prove inadequate.</p>

<p class="article">The project is currently in progress, with the first draft nearing completion. An editor has been acquired to help refine the manuscript before publication.</p>
