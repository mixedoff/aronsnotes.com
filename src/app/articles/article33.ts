    <h3 class="article mb-4">What is culture?</h3>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We use culture to imply lots of things. Some would say that the culture is a shared story. Others would say culture is the next level of our evolution. And some might say that you should be cultured.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      In essence culture is just shared information.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Inventing" fire was arguably one of the defining evolutionary step for humankind. Fire as dangerous as it has a lot of suprisingly useful elements. Such as keeping us warm through long winter nights, use it as weapon to keep beasts away and allow us to cook food. The latter had an even more surprising long term effect as we coevolved. It allowed us to concentrate and preserve calories which then led to our stomach to shrink and our brain to get even bigger.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      You would think that inventing fire was an inevitable step of our evolution and given enough time we would discover it anyways. But that's not true. There were some tribes that even though discovered but also have forgotten the knowledge of fire. This highlights the fact that culture is just information that is being attained and lost every single minute by the human collective consciousness.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Anyways, we became better and better at processing and sharing information. So much so that now our biology can literally not keep up with our cultural pace.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Biological evolution is a slow process. It's driven by natural selection, where genetic mutations occur over generations, and traits that are beneficial for survival or reproduction become more common over time. But this process can take thousands, even millions, of years.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Human beings, however, have developed cultural traits—language, technology, social systems—that change on a much faster timescale. You can go from a stone tool to a space mission in just a few centuries, while evolutionarily, we've barely changed in the last 10,000 years.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Unlike biological traits, cultural traits (like tools, traditions, or societal structures) don't rely on genetics. They're transmitted through learning—parents teach children, individuals adopt new ideas, and societies shift in response to new technologies or ideas. This form of evolution is much faster because it doesn't need to wait for generations of mutations to pass through natural selection.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      For example, once humans discovered fire, it didn't take generations of people to pass on the knowledge; it could be passed on within a single lifetime. But if that knowledge was encoded in our DNA, it would take many generations to spread.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Many of our biological traits were shaped in environments vastly different from the modern world. The "caveman brain" isn't well-suited to a world of smartphones, digital media, or modern political structures. We're still wired to respond to immediate, local threats or to bond in small, face-to-face social groups, but today we face global challenges that require a different kind of thinking and cooperation.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The "mismatch theory" in biology and psychology points out that our evolved instincts don't necessarily match up with modern environments, which can lead to things like stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.

      But I will give you the best hack to attain as much information as possible. It's a story.

      But in essence all these are just informational <abstractions>. Some a little more up and others way down. This book is about informations way down. About beliefs, values and personality. Sets of information that we build our identity up with.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      We don't like to touch the ones underneath and rightly so, because information on upper layers become very dependent on it. For instance every time we touch one of our values a refactoring is needed.

      Shared is also a very important part of this. The story of babel. The ever present struggle between sameness <> otherness.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The problem we have is that shared part became increasingly fragmented. That's because in the postmodern world we live there is no absolute truth. There is only subjective reality. In the echo chambers of social media, its increasingly easy to just find a

      I think we should give the devil its due and say that it's true there are no absolute truth.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      But there are truths that are extremely likely. And that's what we call absolute objective reality or just objective reality for short.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But we have to move to further on the other end of the spectrum and agree on absolute subjective realities too. These on the west use to be the ten commandment. But now this axiomatic paradigms that hold our reality together are crumbling. In the weight of relative subjective truth we increasingly fail to find common ground.

      Alcohol is the most harmful substance in the world. It kills more people than war, terrorism and homicides. If it didn't exist inventing it today would be unthinkable. Yet it is intervowen in much of our culture and we can't imagine life without drinking wine in the mediterraniens, vodka in the arctic and everything in between.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Much of the world struggles with alcohol but the secret unsung hero of alcoholism is Hungary.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Hungary is the most alcoholic nation in the world. Some estimates say that Hungarians brew 60M liters of pálinka every year. Given that Hungary is roughly 9M people that leaves every single individual with 6.67l of pálinka for a year.

      I was laughter at the table.<br>

      Grandfathers passed me to grandsons, mothers to daughters.<br>
      I was rebellion in liquid form. I was defiance in a bottle.<br><br>

      I was also the shadow at the feast.<br>
      I was the fog behind the fire.<br>
      I numbed their wounds, but I also dulled their dreams.<br><br>
      When the country was torn apart after Trianon, when two-thirds of their land was stolen, I was there.<br>

      The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was one of the most dramatic uprisings of the Cold War. For nearly two weeks, students, workers, and ordinary citizens rose against Soviet domination and the communist regime in Hungary. It was a fight for freedom — brief, fiery, and brutally crushed. But like all of Hungary's great tragedies, it became a myth, woven into the nation's spirit.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Let the spirit of Hungary now speak.

    <blockquote class="article mb-4">
      I am Hungary, and in 1956 I burned.<br><br>
      For long years before, the red star weighed heavy upon me.<br>
      Grey men in grey offices rationed bread, censored words, silenced songs.<br>
      They promised order but gave only chains.<br>
      In every factory, in every schoolroom, in every farm field, the silence grew heavy.<br>
      But silence cannot last forever.<br><br>
      Then came October, and the streets began to murmur.<br>
      Young men, students, poets — they carried not guns but verses, not bombs but demands.<br>
      They tore down Stalin's statue, and the earth itself shook with the crash.<br>
      They raised our tricolor with the Soviet emblem cut out, a hole in the middle, a wound turned into a flag.<br><br>
      "Freedom!" they cried, and I was with them.<br>
      For once, the fire that had always smoldered in secret burst into the open.<br>
      The whole nation was drunk, not with pálinka this time, but with hope.<br>
      Mothers carried food to fighters, priests blessed rifles, children filled bottles with petrol and flame.<br>
      Even the stones of Budapest seemed to rise against the tanks.<br><br>
      For twelve days we fought like hell.<br>
      For twelve days, the Hungarians remembered themselves as free.<br>
      But the world watched — and did nothing.<br>
      And then the tanks returned, iron and endless, grinding the dream beneath their treads.<br>
      Soviet fire poured down like rain and Hungary's blood spilled all over the place.<br>
      The young fell in the streets, the poets were dragged away, and the tricolor flag was stained dark with smoke and blood.<br><br>
      But listen well my dear friend: even in defeat, I endured.<br>
      Because freedom tasted once can never be forgotten.<br>
      Because every whispered toast, every hidden song, every drop of pálinka after 1956 carried that same vow:<br>
      "We rose once. We will rise again."<br><br>
      I am Hungary, scarred and stubborn.<br>
      I am the spirit that burns, that will not die.<br>
      1956 was crushed, yes. But it was not lost.<br>
      It still burns in the memory of my people —<br>
      Like fire beneath ash, waiting, waiting, waiting for the spark to rise again.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      The Revolution of 1956 did not succeed. Thousands were killed, even more imprisoned or forced into exile. But its memory remained a seed — proof that Hungarians could still defy empires. Even today, the uprising stands as one of the defining moments of Hungarian identity: tragic, heroic, and unforgotten.
