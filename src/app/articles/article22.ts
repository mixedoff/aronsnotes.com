    <p class="article mb-2">
      I was there—alone in the dark, surrounded by towering walls.
      The room was about ten by ten, windowless, and the door was locked.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      “The little child in the room is safe,”
      said a sharp, cold voice in my head.
      “He is safe, and so are you. You are free to do whatever you want.”
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      And so I did. I accomplished everything I set my mind to.
      But in the end, I felt... empty.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Because deep inside me, the little boy was indeed safe—but he was alone,
      cut off from the outside world.
      Crying out for love and attention he could never receive.
      And even though I was protected, I was also isolated—
      lost in the dark.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Achieving great things, yet never satisfying the hunger within...
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Much later, a girl came.
      She was bold and brave and loud.
      Her hair waved as she banged relentlessly on the door.
      The cold voice tried to keep her out.
      Its sharp tones cut deep into the girl’s flesh, like a bitter wind,
      but she kept knocking.
      Determination lit her eyes—
      she knew the boy was waiting to be found.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      I tried to push her away in every way I could.
      But she kept banging—again and again.
      The voice kept hurting her, and I kept resisting.
      I was afraid she might hurt the boy.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      The girl was persistent. But eventually, she gave in.
      Bruises covered her face and hands.
      The voice and the banging wore her down.
      She dropped to her knees and began to cry.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      “I can’t give up,” she sobbed.
      “The boy needs me.”
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Something clicked.
      She looked up—just as the boy opened the locked door.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      He walked straight to her and pulled a tissue from his pocket.

      “Here you go,” said the boy, offering it to her.

    <p class="article mb-2">
        The girl took it and wiped the tears from her face.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      “I’m sorry for your bruises,” said the boy, sadness filling his wide eyes.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      “It’s okay,” the girl replied with a grin.
      “I knew you'd come out.”
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      “I’m so happy you found me!” the boy said, nearly shouting.
      “I was really alone in there…”
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      He looked at her again and asked hesitantly:

      “Do you want to go out and play with me?”
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      His voice cracked at the end.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      The girl looked into his eyes and paused—just for a second—before answering:

      “I thought you were never going to ask!” she burst out, laughing.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      And they laughed together.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      She grabbed his hand, and they ran off to play.
    </p>
