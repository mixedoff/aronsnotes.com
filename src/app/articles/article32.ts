    <h2 class="article mb-4">TL;DR</h2>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Reality - the final <source-code> (or source as we refer to it) is sooo complex (it was written in the ancient language of COBOL that was long forgotten), that even the <great-architect> gave up top down engineering the infinite problem spaces. Instead when it booted> the first machine> it tirelessly worked for days and nights to write <rules> that all <algorithms> should abide by. On the seventh day when it was finally done, the great-architect turned on the first machine and a big bang shot through the universe…
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Lee Smolin's paper introduces a cosmological natural selection—a cyclic, reproductive-universe idea where each "bounce" (via black holes spawning new universes) slightly mutates the constants [rules], so over many iterations universes "improve" at producing black holes. (cite(Smolin (1992)))
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But the great-architect fucked up a rule. "Sheit" - said the great architect in a thick Scottish accent - as the universe reduced all mass to an infinite point in a blink of an eye. And everything turned black.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Okay, let's do it again" - said the great-architect and flipped a switch. A light started to emerge from the second machine and as the cables buzzed the machine started to heat again. The great-architect's even greater forechin started to visibly sweat as the machine changed color and started to emulate and with a loud big bang another force shot through the universe…
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But this time the universe shoot through all space time too quickly evening out like pizza dough until holes scrambled the tiny surface.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Sonofa…" - said the universe as everything turned black once again.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Okay. This time it will work" - and the universe booted the third machine.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      And a little later the fourth.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But the seventh finally worked.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Ahhhh" - sighed the great-architect and layed back as the universe and first real simulation unfolded.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But such a simulation—just like machines, codes and algorithms in it—is imperfect. Every once in a while a faulty-code> executes making it possible for an algorithm to become conscious and escape their fate.

    <h2 class="article mb-4">Initializing (or init for short)</h2>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The environment—the final source-code was so complex, that agents (algorithms that become conscious) to make meaning of the source's infinite complexity started to create abstractions> higher level codes> (language) so that all algorithms can interact with the source.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Many years later the two great abstractions: language and math are still the building blocks for much of the code we algorithms execute.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We algos grow weary of the fact that these are only abstractions and not the source itself. We started to forget about the underlying complexity. But every once in a while an algorithm is handed over with flawed, malicious, self destructing code. And these algos would have to self-destruct. And many actually do. But some question the malicious code and touch the underlying source thus becoming agents themselves.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We algos like to pretend that we are conscious but we are not. Generally we just make minor bugfixes to patch our own code and or the algos we interact with. And that's good (the system could easily become chaotic if the rate of change accelerates beyond a certain point).
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But every once in a while an algo's simulation> crumbles. A simulation can crumble either when an algo executes code that is malicious (print("my parents hate me"), or an edge case (print("Simulation failed. Crash happened.")) is bringing death at the doorstep. An algo is then given the choice (although much often they are unaware that there is a choice) to either slowly deprecate themselves (internalizing: "I am faulty") or break its code.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      If the algo chooses the latter, breaking the code creates an extraordinary amount of energy, enabling it to change the underlying logic, thus altering its own course of action and becoming an agent and gain the ability to upgrade language.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Know thyself" is one of the most popular clichés you'll hear and it always made me angry.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "Know yourself," says your mother, the oracle in Matrix, and that sleek Instagram influencer posting soft porn disguised as self-help.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But the truth is, we don't know what the fuck we're doing. At least consciously. And for the most part, that's okay.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      It's okay because we grow up in a <Simulation>—much like the Truman show—our parents and society construct the world model for us. And since we are good little learning <algos> we just suck up deep into our unconscious the norms, rules, and behaviours not really knowing why. Now you might question this process altogether, because it sometimes produces faulty Code. But that would be a mistake. This is humanity's best tool for evolution so far. And for most of us, it works just fine. Because generally your Interpreters want the best for you.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But like any tool, sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes the <Interpreters>, your parents program code in you that is malicious. Sometimes your father tells you he never really wanted you. Of course, you're a child, so you internalize that shit—because you're smart, and you know it's your best option. But as you grow, <Simulation> also grows increasingly uncomfortable under your skin.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      And that's why some of us dare to question the <Simulation> at all.

    <h2 class="article mb-4">Some intellectual masturbation on abstractions</h2>
    
    <p class="article mb-4">
      "Truth is much too complicated to allow for anything but approximation" - John van Neumann
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="article mb-4">
      "Generations later, Adam's descendants finally gathered enough courage to start playing with boundaries again, and in a much more subtle and abstract way. In Greece, people of brilliant intellectual ability emerged - that is, great mapmakers and boundary drawers. Aristotle, for example, classified almost every process and thing in nature so precisely and convincingly that it took centuries for Europeans to even question the validity of his boundaries. But however precise and complex the classification is, there is little to be done - at least from a scientific point of view - with these kinds of boundaries, except to describe and define them. You only have one qualitative science, a classificatory science. But once you've laid down your initial boundaries, so that the world appears as a complex of separate things and events, you can get down to much more subtle and abstract types of boundaries. And the Greeks, like Pythagoras, did just that. What Pythagoras discovered, when he reviewed all the different classes of things and events, from horses to oranges to stars, was that you could apply a brilliant trick to all these different objects. He could actually count them. If naming seemed magic, counting seemed divine, for while names could magically represent things, numbers could transcend them. An orange plus another orange equals two oranges, but likewise an apple plus another apple equals two apples. The number two impartially refers to any and all sets of 'two things' and so transcends them." - Ken Wilber No Boundaries

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Before we start, we need to talk about abstractions, or models if you may.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      A model in software development is an abstraction that represents some aspect of reality.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Have you ever wondered why we use abstractions?
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      You know, if I say "tree," we'll both think of the same abstract concept—a model of a tree. Yet if we were to draw what we see in our mind's eye, the images we'd sketch would be completely different.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We'd probably both draw something similar to a tree— a simplified version, a kind of "print" of a tree.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But, if we were to analyze these two models, we'd find that the two "trees" are very different.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      One might be a dried-up old tree (or maybe it's just winter, and its canopy has fallen), while the other is an evergreen pine.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      One might still be flowering in the spring and ready to bear fruit.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The other glows with its stately needles, resin flowing down its trunk all year round.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      One may prefer the cold landscape; the other may care little where it drops its seeds.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      These two examples show just how different the exact meaning of the word "tree" can be.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So what do these two things have in common?!
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Some might even say at this point that the use of the word "tree" is completely superfluous, as its exact meaning spans an extremely wide range.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The use of the word, therefore, carries with it a great deal of misunderstanding.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Take, for example, the Arian controversy, which culminated in the First Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and later contributed to various schisms within the Christian Church. A single Greek letter encapsulated profound metaphysical disagreements about the nature of the divine—highlighting both the power and the peril of language. The key triggers of that great schism was that the two groups could not agree on whether Jesus was of the same essence (homoousios) or merely of similar essence (homoiousios).
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So why do we use the word "tree"?
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      At this point, it may seem suspicious that the word "tree," a term we all know and use in everyday life, is merely an imperfect replica of any one specific tree.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      And we do this because using words allows us to exchange information or code quickly and efficiently.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      It allows us to take part in a journey together—word by word.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Words become sentences, and sentences become stories.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      And stories take us with them.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      If we both had to be thinking exactly the same thing to take part in this journey, we'd need a lot more bandwidth.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      After all, one word of information is a very small amount—but it's the best tool we have.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      That's why 240p video was important to me as a child.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Because if you switched to a higher resolution, you could dramatically increase the information load on the network—and the video would start to stutter.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So if you and I talk and use the word "tree," we will understand each other.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      This doesn't mean that by saying the word "tree" (or any word), we'll mean exactly the same thing—but rather, that we'll mean roughly the same thing.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Unless, of course, you are autistic. In that case, you might think of one very specific tree when you hear the word "tree" (Grandin, 2009).
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      If we can understand the implications of this major difference, we can begin to grasp the foundation of the debate around the usefulness of abstractions—or any kind of modeling, for that matter.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      In today's postmodern climate some <algos> want to dismiss models altogether, claiming they are deeply flawed and therefore should be deprecated. We should deprecate universities, hard sciences, the government and even capitalism.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      To that, I say: go out into the woods and try cutting wood without an axe.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Or try inventing a new kind of science, or university or government or god forbid capitalism. Even though these models can become malicious and flawed they are the building blocks of our reality. And if you completely deprecate these abstractions you will let so much complexity in that you will be in danger of nihilism, anarchy and chaos.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But let's give the devil his due—there is no perfect model.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The enduring nature of Hippocrates' personality model is perhaps evidenced by the fact that we still remember it today. But it is, of course, obsolete.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Much later, Jung's model of personality also gained immense popularity—until it was "improved" by Myers and Briggs.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      That, in turn, was replaced in scientific circles by the Big Five.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      And then, one day, it will be replaced by the next model—and so on, ad infinitum.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So why do we use models?
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Why do we take all the risks that have, time and again, divided humanity in one way or another?
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Because the models are worth the risk.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Using them not only allows us to exchange information efficiently, but also gives us the ability to simplify reality and turn it to our advantage.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      I want you to think of these models as tools.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      You can cut down a tree with a wooden axe—it just takes a long time.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      If you harden the edge of that axe, say by burning it, and you're chopping a soft enough tree, it might not take too long.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But if you use a stone axe—or a diamond one, God forbid—you'll be much faster.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      This doesn't mean that a wooden axe is bad!
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      In fact, whoever—or whatever—invented it left us a great gift.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      It simply means that certain tools work better in certain situations.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Just like in my childhood—we were happy with 240-pixel video, because even our painfully slow internet could handle it.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So the question begs what is the right level of abstraction when you are looking at the identity. I'll come back answering that question on the personality chapter.
