      This sci-fi book is a masterpiece. The story is amazing with very unexpected twists and turns, and it has three-dimensional characters that feel like real people.

      The premise is deceptively simple: the rest of humanity lives in a massive silo, miles deep, with strict rules and different castes. We all know this world. But as the story unfolds, I found myself over and over on the edge of my seat.

    <p class="article mb-2">
      And the characters, man.

      I have just put down Snow Crash, which, to give the devil its due, has insane world-building. I mean, Neal Stephenson dreamt up the Metaverse in 1992. And the story, I have heard, is quite the thing. But the characters, for me, felt very shallow. The book was a disappointment even though the premise hooked me.

      Now that I think about it, if I were to rank these elements, I would put:
    <ol>
      <li>Characters</li>
      <li>Story</li>
      <li>World</li>
    </ol>
        </p>

      Recently, I have been struggling to find a good book to read. This book has inspired me to always look for something outstanding.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      Also, since the first book (wool) was hastily self-published by the author, with zero promotion, and became a massive hit, this made my faith stronger that readers do have taste.
    </p>

    <p class="article mb-2">
      I highly recommend reading it.
