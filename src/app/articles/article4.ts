<h2>summary</h2>
<p><strong>I tried to be succinct</strong> cause we all have finite time 
but if you have any questions, concerns, or comments 
I am happy to dwell deeper. Just shoot me an email (about page)! </p>
<br>

<p><strong>You will find below the jist of CareeVerz.com's 
design system and some screens on the final UI.</strong> 
This article covers the 6 months journey of designing each and every screen for 
CareeVerz.com a career counseling AI web app.</p>
<blockquote>CareeVerze's mission is to become â€œa compass in the world of work".</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>UX requirements</h2>
<p>Of course, everything starts with requirements. 
In this case, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. 
<strong>Our Team has already built the 
UX wireframes previously (see UX articles for more details), 
which were already defined at a pretty high level (see pic below).</strong> 
<br>

<br>

<p>This high level of design might scare some designers away, 
but not me! I love constraints. Constraints enable creativity.</p>
<br>
<p>We also had a design system in place, 
which meant that with just a few clicks we could transform this beast into... 
well... a pretty beast.</p>
<br>

<p>So this begs the question: is the work done?</p>
<br>
<p><s>Of course, we have the contemporary blue logo, 3D images, 
and gradients!</s></p>
<br>
<p>No, not all! This only means we can test our hypothesis
 with a prototype that will not scare users away.</p>
<br>
<p>And since the testing was done, 
we gathered the necessary feedback from our users, which is good!</p>
<br>
<blockquote>You should be as close to your users as possible.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In essence: <strong>the feedback from users highlighted that 
there are some key screens that take up most of the user's attention.</strong>
These were the landing page, the careepoints pages, and the results page. 
Therefore the ux requirement was to make these pages engaging.</p>
