    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We have created a dedicated LinkedIn profile for <strong>codingmindtech</strong> and with that laid the foundations for our AI and tech-focused sub-brand identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We'll use <strong>Montserrat</strong>, which is visually quite close to our parent brand’s Nunito, maintaining modernity and legibility while offering slightly more geometric precision.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Palette</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      We're starting with a <strong>black-and-white high-contrast aesthetic</strong>, which reflects simplicity, clarity, and a sharp, confident presence — especially effective in tech branding.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But we spice things up with a subtle touch of <em>custom-drawn elements</em> to balance the minimalism with personality.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      This serves two key purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It creates a focal point, drawing the eye toward key visual elements — in this case, ‘tech’, to distinguish from our parent brand.</li>
      <li>It introduces energy, ensuring the brand doesn’t come across as too sterile or corporate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Look & Feel</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The overall visual identity should feel:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean, bold, minimalistic</strong> — sharp precision combined with…</li>
      <li><strong>Playfulness</strong> — because only a custom-made, imperfect yet beautiful human can create art with code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Combining both forward-thinking, resonating with top-tier AI talent and partners, yet a welcoming human community.
    </p>

    <h2>Logo</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      For the logo, we designed an <strong>infinity symbol</strong>.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/img/article18/co_logo.png" alt="codingmindtech logo" class="whiteBoard mb-2">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timeless & Modern:</strong> Represents continuity, scalability, and a future-forward mindset — essential for an AI-driven company.</li>
      <li><strong>Symbol of Perfection:</strong> Its endless form evokes elegance, precision, and flow in both code and collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Loop = Iteration & Learning:</strong> Reflects the nature of machine learning cycles — evolving through feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Two Loops, Two Perspectives:</strong> Dual interwoven curves reflect balance between tech & humanity, structure & creativity, data & intuition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The two loops have subtly distinct shades, suggesting <strong>collaboration</strong> — distinct minds working in harmony.
    </p>

    <h2>Cover Image</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      While the ideal cover would feature a close-up of 2–3 teammates collaborating over a laptop — to visually communicate teamwork, creativity, and a sense of community — we previously agreed that capturing such a shot isn’t feasible at the moment.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Instead, we have a <strong>custom background title graphic</strong> that maintains a clean, professional look while hinting at our values and vibe.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      Again, the focal point of the title is <strong>codingmindtech</strong> to distinguish it from the parent brand.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/img/article18/title1.png" alt="codingmindtech title" class="blackBoard mb-2">

    <h2>Custom ‘co’ Letterform</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      The ‘co’ in our logo is custom-designed, giving it a distinct identity within the brand system. It’s not just a stylized abbreviation — it’s a visual anchor.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/img/article18/title2.png" alt="codingmindtech title" class="blackBoard mb-2">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Built for Motion:</strong> Modular and flexible shapes open doors for future animations — entrances, loops, scroll-responsive motion.</li>
      <li><strong>Brand Utility:</strong> This custom ‘co’ could evolve into a standalone visual mark — favicon, app icon, animated loader.</li>
      <li><strong>Narrative Potential:</strong> Playfully hints at COllaboration (co-creation, co-evolution, co-intelligence), reinforcing our human-centered, community-forward approach.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Human Touch</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      While the clean aesthetic brings clarity and structure, we’re mindful not to drift into cold minimalism. To balance this:
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/img/article18/linkedin_cover.png" alt="codingmindtech linkedin cover" class="blackBoard mb-2">
    <ul>
      <li>We’ll incorporate a subtle human touch in the background design.</li>
      <li>We aim to introduce just enough imperfection to feel real, warm, and relatable.</li>
    </ul>

      This duality — clean yet human, precise yet expressive — mirrors how we approach technology itself: powerful tools, made for and by people.
