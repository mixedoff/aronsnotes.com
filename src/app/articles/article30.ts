    <h6>book overview</h6>
    <p class="article">Ray Kurzweil's book "The Singularity Is Nearer" (2024) is a sequel to his influential 2005 work "The Singularity Is Near." It presents updated predictions and insights about the exponential progress of artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and other transformative technologies, focusing on the concept of the Singularity—a future moment when human intelligence will merge with advanced AI.</p>
    
    <h6>main predictions</h6>
    <p class="article">Kurzweil continues to predict that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI will reach human-level intelligence by 2029</li>
      <li>By around 2045, humans will merge with machines (the Singularity), massively expanding human intelligence and abilities</li>
      <li>The period leading up to the Singularity will bring radical life extension, advanced nanotechnologies, and the potential for humans to connect their brains to the cloud</li>
      <li>Exponential technological growth will improve every aspect of human well-being, including health, poverty, violence reduction, and access to energy and resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>we are marching toward the singularity</h6>
    <p class="article">Kudos to Kurzweil because as much as it isn't a radical idea now that AI will reach and surpass human-level intelligence, it was when he published the first book ("The Singularity Is Near") in 2005.</p>
    
    <blockquote>"Singularity" is a term borrowed from physics, referring to when a star's mass collapses into a point of infinite density; when this happens, known laws of physics break down. Kurzweil uses "singularity" to describe when technological growth—especially in AI—becomes so rapid that it results in fundamentally unpredictable changes to human civilization.</blockquote>

    <p class="article">So the guy does really know a thing or two (he is an accomplished Google engineer after all, with major AI inventions and a successful startup exit under his belt) and to his credit, the technological progress rapidly accelerates toward the points he envisioned.</p>

    <h6>the employment challenge</h6>
    <p class="article">Nevertheless, the single-handed optimism that he holds throughout the book is alarming. As much as the beauty is evident (at least for me) in expanding our consciousness with technological layers, this major shift will also bring, well, major sociological and economical shi(f)t.</p>
    
    <p class="article">People like to say that technological advancement creates more jobs than it replaces, but I am worried that this revolution may evaporate entire sectors.</p>

    <p class="article">About 10% of the U.S. workforce is employed in transportation and warehousing-related jobs, such as truck driving, package sorting, and delivery. This makes it a major employment sector.</p>

    <p class="article">Now what will happen if self-driving cars will replace truck drivers? And if automated warehouses make human sorters obsolete? And if drones will handle all the last-mile delivery?</p>

    <p class="article">Okay, but at least we will still have the mechanics, right?</p>

    <p class="article">Well, what if robots will do the repair and maintenance too?</p>

    <p class="article">Algorithms already handle much of the route coordination for deliveries. Heck, we might even automate robot production.</p>

    <p class="article">Is it possible that 9.9% out of the 10% will be human-less?</p>

    <p class="article">And if so, what are those people gonna do?</p>

    <p class="article">Perhaps we can find jobs for them in other sectors!</p>

    <p class="article">But what if those sectors are also "shrinking"?</p>

    <p class="article">Because alongside transportation, other sectors such as manufacturing, administrative, retail, customer service, finance and food services (just to name the major ones) are also shrinking.</p>

    <h6>the accelerating change</h6>
    <p class="article">Okay, just hold on for a sec. Let's put this aside for the time being, with the hope that these people will be able to retrain and find other meaningful work. Still, we haven't talked about the scariest part: the change is accelerating.</p>

    <blockquote>"The Singularity Is Near" introduced Kurzweil's "Law of Accelerating Returns"—the idea that technology evolves exponentially, especially in computing, AI, genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.</blockquote>

    <p class="article">Because today's technological advancements create positive feedback loops.</p>

    <p class="article">For instance, an AI advance might accelerate biological research in protein folding. This, in turn, could enable a synthetic biological invention, which would provide richer, more complex datasets and new challenges that drive further AI development. These loops will propel us faster and faster to the point where humans and technology (just like a singularity) "collapse" together and transform into something entirely different.</p>

    <p class="highlight">
      But in the meantime, I am left wondering: How much more speed can human society take?
