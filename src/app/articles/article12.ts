  <p class="article">So I played with this...</p> 
  <img class="mt-0" src="./assets/img/article12/image3.png" >
  <br>

  <p class="article">I converted it to standard square form...</p>  
  <img class="mt-0" src="./assets/img/article12/image4.png" >

  <p class="article">In addition to the black hole, I also played with the sun...</p>

  <p class="article mb-2">At this point I was satisfied! So I asked for feedback from a design expert... She also liked the first version called "eclipse" (black hole + sun) the best!! Only the font is too thin... </p>
  
  <p class="article mb-2">... which is a problem because there's no thicker font from Dune Rise...</p>
  
  <p class="article mb-2">But I figured with a trick i could make it thicker! I added contour to it... Ladies and gentlemen, low and behold our logo:</p>

  <img src="./assets/img/article12/image6.png" >
  <br>

  <p>In the eclipse version: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>the sun is blurred in the background</li>
  <li> our font is bolded</li>
  <li>and layered so that the “sun can shine on it”</li>
  </ul>
