      This is the best piece of management book I have ever read. Period. And I have read pretty much all the management books that I could lay my hand on. The effective executive, One minute manager, Lead not manage, Good to great, Built to last, Start with why, The 7 habits of highly effective people, How to win friends, The five dysfunction… and the list goes on… 
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      None of the latter books had come close to the kind of perspective this book offers. And none could I relate on such a personal level, because here is the hard truth my friend, it sucks to be a CEO.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Even if your company is winning, the level of pressure on you is just insane. It's non-stop work, weekends included. You have to use all your available resources just to stay in the game. And no matter how well you do sooner or later you will have to fire somebody you really like.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Disclaimer: I wanted to be a CEO for such a long time. I loved the idea of grueling pressure turning a mere piece of coal into a diamond. But then I watched the days in the lives of the Tim Cooks, the Jensen Huangs, and Bob Igers. The harsh reality of waking up at 4 am just to halve your inbox till normal people start to wake up… And I have started to wonder: is this a prize worth winning?
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Nevertheless, these CEOs are still my people on some level, and I am still fascinated by them. And it's worth knowing that when life gives you lemons, and your company faces bankruptcy, you can still lay off half of your company and use your leftover cash to double down on your last bet…
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      To be honest, I will probably come back for some frank advice on hiring, firing, and transitioning. But in the meantime, there were two concepts that really stood out for me in the book. Let me dive into each.
    </p>
    <h2>Peace time CEO / Wartime CEO</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      I have long been fascinated by the complex and chaotic state.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      When I lived in Hungary I checked the weather once a week. I looked at my weather application and instantly had a good estimate of how the forthcoming week would look. But since I moved to the Netherlands this has completely changed. I look at the weather application every single day. Sometimes even multiple times a day. Because the weather in the Netherlands changes so freaking fast that the applications lag.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Fun fact: In Holland, there is an extreme sport called the Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships that is organized every year next to the coast. It only starts when the wind speed reaches at least 50km/h. The year before it was canceled because the wind was too big…
    </blockquote>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      So why bring this up? It's because just like the weather, the state of business sometimes shifts from complex to chaotic, and different rules start to apply!
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Most contemporary business has shifted from the complicated to the complex realm. BUT the thing that kept me on my toes was how the complex changes to chaotic?
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      But now thanks to the book I know! It's all about war.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      The complex state changes to chaotic when the environment or the organization moves too fast. 
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      War is when the company is running out of resources fast. War is when market conditions change so rapidly that the existing business is disappearing. War when the company is destabilizing and on the brink of extinction.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      When such a state applies, rules change, and the organization can not afford to experiment because uncertainty destroys. In these hard times, the CEO is the General, and the Company must act together swiftly to survive.
    </p>
    <h2>What's the function of the CEO?</h2>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      This question has long been bothering me… Cause it's not that straightforward… Is it managing the performance of the team? Or is it coaching people for professional growth? Is it capital allocation? Hiring world-class talent? Or deciding the strategic direction of the company? Is it all? Or is it any?
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      Almost everybody is better at one thing than another. And in my humble opinion that is especially true for high achievers. Think about the 10x developer who has zero soft skills.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      A mistake I see large companies make is they hire for lack of weaknesses instead of strength.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      When you assess any executive think about which strength you want and which weaknesses you tolerate.
    </p>
    <p class="article mb-2 highlight">
      This categorization from the book I found very useful:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        “Will the executive be world-class at running the <strong>function</strong>? “
      </li>
      <li>
        “Is the executive outstanding <strong>operationally</strong>?“
      </li>
      <li>
        “Will the executive make a major contribution to the <strong>strategic direction</strong> of the company? This is the “are they smart enough?” criterion.” 
      </li>
      <li>
        “Will the executive be an <strong>effective member of the team</strong>? Effective is the key word. It's possible for an executive to be well liked and totally ineffective with respect to the other members of the team. It's also possible for an executive to be highly effective and profoundly influential while being totally despised. The latter is far better.”
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="article mb-2">
      "These functions do not carry equal weight for all positions. Make sure that you balance them appropriately."
    </p>
