    <p><strong>Life is the game of all games</strong></p>
    <p>I have long been haunted by this question:</p>
    <p><em>What is a game? </em></p>
    <p>My best answer so far was from Jesse Schell‚Äôs book (link to my note):</p>
    <p>
      ‚ÄúA game is any problem solving activity approached with a playful
      attitude.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wasn‚Äôt super happy with this definition because it‚Äôs sort of a
      tautology. Anyhow, this was just another thing at the back of my mind
      until suddenly I found an answer in a very unexpected place:
      <em>Complexity Science</em> by Mitchell Waldrop
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to this book, I was able to conjure up a much better definition:
    </p>
    <p>A game is adapting to the environment.</p>
    <p>
      Every species has its own <em>game</em>. They acquire a niche within the
      bounds of nature and try to stick with it through thick and thin. But we
      humans are different. We specialized in a very, very handy niche: niche
      switching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, our game <em>is</em> adaptation. Unlike the rest of the
      world, we are able to accomplish all sorts of extraordinary feats. We can
      climb a tree, split the atom, and help an old lady walk to the other side
      of the road. The spectrum of what we can do, just like the universe, is
      expanding.
    </p>
    <p>Summa summarum:</p>
    <p>every human has their own <em>game</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>What the f@ck is Life?</strong></p>
    <p>
      A long, long time ago, far, far away in a distant galaxy, the Universe
      realized that the space of possibilities to compute was just too vast‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
      Computation is the process of calculating or solving something using a set
      of rules (an algorithm). In simple terms, it‚Äôs how we turn input (like
      numbers, data, or instructions) into output (like answers, results, or
      actions) through logical steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conceivable combinations of things are effectively infinite. For
      instance, let‚Äôs pick a humble 1000-gene seaweed. To find the best
      combination, the Universe would have to examine each and every gene,
      because each combination is potentially better. Now, if you work out the
      total number, it‚Äôs actually not 2 multiplied by 1000. It‚Äôs 2 multiplied by
      itself 1000-fold‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs 2-to-the-1000 ‚Äî
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚Äúa number so vast that it makes even the number of moves in chess seem
      infinitesimal.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
      And we are still talking about a mere seaweed and not a mammal that has
      roughly 100 times as many genes‚Äîand most of those genes come in many more
      than two varieties. Not to mention if you start comparing things, because
      we are not in a bubble, and <em>better</em> can only be understood through
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a computational nightmare. So the Universe has decided to
      outsource computation to Life. But the Universe didn‚Äôt want to give away
      all control. After all, what is creativity without constraints? So the
      Universe, in its graceness, has created rules‚Äîlimits to what is and what
      can be. It created a canvas and then handed over the brush to Life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>A brief history of Life</strong></p>
    <p>
      And so, quarks emerged about 10‚Åª¬π¬≤ seconds after the Big Bang‚Äîfrom God
      knows where‚Äîand <em>physics</em> was born. A microsecond later, those
      quarks formed atoms. A lot later (around 100,000 years), the universe had
      cooled sufficiently for the first molecule to form from neutral atoms.
      <em>Chemistry</em> was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first molecule was actually helium hydride (HeH‚Å∫), created when
      neutral helium atoms combined with protons or hydrogen nuclei.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, helium hydride reacted with atomic hydrogen to form molecular
      hydrogen (H‚ÇÇ), which became the most abundant molecule in the universe,
      which then became the primary fuel for star formation (but that only
      happened at the <em>Cosmic Dawn</em>, roughly 100 million years later‚Ä¶).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our beloved mud ball, the Earth, formed a LOT later around 4.5 billion
      years ago (roughly 10 billion years after the Big Bang). Another billion
      years (give or take a couple hundred million), and <em>prokaryotes</em>,
      the first forms of cellular life, emerged on Earth. And so
      <em>biology</em> was born‚Ä¶ Around 1.5 billion years ago, those prokaryotes
      merged and formed a cooperative relationship, leading to the evolution of
      <em>eukaryotic</em> cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things started to really escalate here, and biology was becoming more and
      more complicated. Which leads us to the start of our species, arguably
      something like 300,000 years ago in South Africa, where one monkey stood
      on two legs. Thus, <em>humans</em> were born. We then, ingenious apes,
      invented some mind-blowing stuff like language, writing, and religion, and
      in turn formed more and more complex tribes. <em>Culture</em> was born.
      Fast forward to 4000 BCE, and the first known civilization rises and
      falls, and from their ashes, more and more complex societies emerged‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p><strong>Hey! Isn‚Äôt this just‚Ä¶ evolution? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Well‚Ä¶ yes, and no. Life is indeed forming more and more complex layers,
      BUT strictly speaking, what we call <em>evolution</em> is only the
      biological layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evolution is defined as the change in the heritable characteristics of
      biological populations over successive generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that Life has never stopped evolving on ALL layers. Atoms are
      still forming more and more elaborate structures. Simple molecules are
      still mingling to find ever more combinations that fit. And your brain is
      still trying to come up with new stuff in this very moment‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Okay, I get it now. Physics, chemistry, biology, humans, culture, and
        societies are still evolving, right? </em
      >Exactly! But the evolution of Life, just like the Universe, is
      <em>non-linear</em>.
    </p>
    <p>The output is not proportional to the input.</p>
    <p><strong>Life is coevolving.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The life of a token</strong></p>
    <p>
      To capture the essence of Life, we will now follow the life of a token. I
      want you to imagine a small bit. Actually, not just a bit, but bits of
      ones and zeros. Like 0111000 or 1100110. Now, for the sake of simplicity,
      let‚Äôs say that we have 100 of these running around. But they by themselves
      are useless. We need something more to bring them to life. We need a
      hypothesis. Now, if we have some tokens and if we can summon hypotheses,
      then we have the smallest bit of Life. We have an <em>Agent</em>.
    </p>
    <p><em>And that‚Äôs good - said the Universe. </em></p>
    <p>
      But just like us, Agents by themselves are meaningless. We need an
      environment that they can exist in. We need Mother Nature (which is
      basically everything except the Agent). And now we have established all
      the important roles on the stage of Life, and now they can start acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature, the environment, tends to go first, and with that, a situation
      arises. And every time a situation arises, an Agent can bid some of its
      tokens and an associated strength (hypothesis) to compete with or against
      Nature. Let‚Äôs say the Agent summons 0110011 with the strength 0.12. Now
      let‚Äôs say that this Agent is lucky and this was a good combo. Now the
      Agent will gain some strength. 0110011 was a good token in this situation,
      and the associated strength might rise up to 0.23.
    </p>
    <p><em>This is good! - said the Agent. </em></p>
    <p>
      But Nature does not sleep. It posts another challenge‚Äîa pattern, a
      situation, a problem‚Äîand the Agent bids 0110011 again with the hypothesis
      0.23. And it wins again! Wow! Such token. Much value. Now, to bless this
      good fortune, Nature has chosen this special token and another lucky one,
      let‚Äôs say 1001100, to give birth to a new token. Mhmmm. And their baby
      will share some of their distinctive nature but will also be somewhat
      different. Let‚Äôs say we cut each token in half: 0110 and 1100, and put the
      two together. The baby now will almost be identical to half of the
      parents, but since the length was not even, this baby will gain one digit
      extra length. Same but different. Now this fresh token will have a chance
      to show who is daddy. But unfortunately, this poor token loses a couple of
      matches and sadly flushes away.
    </p>
    <p><em>Nature can be a bitch. </em></p>
    <p>
      Of course, this Agent is not limited to bid only one token. Life, and thus
      Nature, is getting more complex by the hour. So the Agent can bid more to
      up her game. And to spice things up, more Agents appear on the stage of
      Life, and they also start bidding their tokens. At first, the distribution
      of Life is random‚Äîsome Agents flush away, others barely scrape by. But as
      the Agents interact with Nature, they paint more and more elaborate
      structures. Some combos turn out to be pretty good ones. An Agent
      terminates many more Agents by this hack. Another Agent comes up with a
      cooperation of a lesser-known Agent that turns out to be quite
      advantageous. New and new tokens emerge, and with them, more and more
      sophisticated hypotheses are being summoned. Nature blesses with strength
      the fittest, and the more they accumulate, the more layers of Life it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>This is silly. How could this apply to anything in real life?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly, I am not sure if this informational layer is actually part of
      Life (although many scientists would argue that it is). I just brought it
      up because, in an abstract sense, we see Life at the smallest bits. Now
      that we have the theoretical basis of Life (and how LLMs work), we can
      zoom in and out of the natural layers of Life to see how it is coevolving.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Life is coevolving</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs zoom in now, deep into the chemical layer, and watch a simple
      reaction: the formation of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature, our environment, sets the stage: two hydrogen atoms (let‚Äôs call
      them 0101 and 0110) and one oxygen atom (1001) drift close together. Since
      bottom-up hypotheses are an emergent phenomenon from the biological realm,
      they have to stick with good old-fashioned top-down hypotheses: rules.
      Like this chemical rule: if two hydrogens and one oxygen are nearby, and
      enough energy is present, they can bond to form H‚ÇÇO. The atoms ‚Äúbid‚Äù their
      potential‚Äîand if the conditions are right, the hypothesis is successful: a
      water molecule forms. The new molecule is more stable, so Nature ‚Äúrewards‚Äù
      it‚Äîenergy is released, and the molecule is more likely to persist. But
      Nature is never done. The environment changes: maybe a burst of UV light
      hits, or a nearby molecule collides. The water molecule might break apart,
      losing its ‚Äústrength.‚Äù Or it might encounter other molecules and join a
      bigger structure‚Äîice, or a complex organic compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let‚Äôs zoom out, to the cultural layer, and have a look at how language
      evolved. The first ingenious monkey invented the word: ‚Äúdanger.‚Äù Of
      course, it didn‚Äôt sound this sophisticated. It was more like a big monkey
      shout. But this brute tone turned out to be pretty effective. It had the
      effect of signaling to fellow monkeys that danger was near, but it also
      could surprise or even scare the attacker. It also had an emergent
      property. Because this innovation turned out to be pretty effective, it
      spread among the monkey population (and a few generations down the road,
      we still unconsciously shout in danger).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >That‚Äôs all fair and square, but I am still not sure‚Äîhow do these layers
        connect?</em
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>Inter-layer feedback</strong></p>
    <p>
      Well, that‚Äôs a great question! The secret to how these layers interact is
      <em>emergence</em> and <em>feedback</em>. What happens at one layer can
      give rise to new patterns, rules, and agents at the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take our water molecule. Alone, it‚Äôs just a stable structure. But when
      millions of water molecules come together, they create new
      properties‚Äîliquidity, surface tension, the ability to dissolve other
      substances. These emergent properties make what we call
      <em>life</em> (biology) possible: water forms the medium where the first
      cells could assemble, where DNA and proteins could fold and interact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, fast-forward to our clever monkeys. Their biology‚Äîvocal cords and
      brain‚Äîmakes it possible for them to invent and share signals. The first
      ‚Äúdanger‚Äù shout is a biological event, but it becomes a cultural one the
      moment it‚Äôs understood by another. The word is a token, the shout is a
      bid, and the hypothesis is:
      <em
        >‚ÄúIf I make this sound, others will react in a way that helps us
        survive.‚Äù</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As the signal proves effective, it spreads. Not through genes, but through
      memes (culture).
    </p>
    <p>
      Memes‚Äîunits of cultural transmission‚Äîevolving alongside genes. Today, I
      guess this cultural (and informational) layer(s) where Life evolves the
      fastest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the flow isn‚Äôt one-way. Information on the cultural layer can reach
      down and change biology and chemistry. For instance, when we humans
      learned to cook food, we changed the chemical structure of what we ate and
      made the food more dense, ultimately altering our own biology‚Äîwe needed
      less space for our stomachs so that our brains could evolve bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most shocking study I have found on the topic of interaction between
      layers is this very famous one showing that beliefs‚Äîself-perceptions about
      aging‚Äîcan significantly affect the length of a person‚Äôs life. To vastly
      simplify: if you believe that stress is bad, you will live much shorter.
      <em>(Levy et al., 2002)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with the advent of large language models, we‚Äôre building new
      agents‚Äîartificial ones‚Äîwhose tokens are words and whose environment is the
      vast sea of human knowledge. These agents also learn, and adapt, and even
      generate (hallucinate) new ideas, feeding the output back into the
      socio-cultural and informational layer, fueling the evolution of our
      species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key thing boils down to <em>connection</em>. The power in the system
      is mostly relational, not individualistic. It‚Äôs this dance between
      <em>emergence</em> and <em>feedback</em>. Sometimes, a tiny change at the
      bottom‚Äîa mutation in DNA, a new chemical reaction‚Äîripples upward, changing
      the course of evolution. Other times, a breakthrough at the top‚Äîa new
      word, a new technology‚Äîreaches down and reshapes the very fabric of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, <strong>Life is not just a thing, but a process</strong>: a
      never-ending search for fit structures, a conversation between layers, a
      mingling of tokens in the grand canvas of Nature.
    </p>
    <p><em>So... What should I do with this?</em></p>
    <p><strong>Life is a game</strong></p>
    <p>
      Well, first and foremost, this paints a bright picture for Agents.
      Realizing that we are all part of the same grand canvas can give us a
      sense of deep purpose. Our actions matter‚Äînot just for us, but for the
      whole Universe. Every change we make can ripple outward, influencing other
      Agents and shaping the layers of Nature, perhaps in very unexpected ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apart from meaning, we as Humans are in some sense very special. The
      secret hack that only we can do is that we <em>consciously</em> change our
      game. Every single Agent of Life is playing a game, but most of them
      follow the rules unconsciously and obediently. We are the only ones who
      can not just follow rules, but also <em>make</em> or <em>break</em> them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚ÄúThis is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the
      Matrix. It has the same basic rules‚Äîrules like gravity. What you must
      learn is that these rules are no different than the rules of a computer
      system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken. Understand?‚Äù -
      Morpheus
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we can‚Äôt bend physics (yet), we do have increasingly more influence
      over the socio-biological-cultural-informational layers.
    </p>
    <p>So here is your quest:</p>
    <p><strong>Find your game</strong></p>
    <p>
      I encourage you to find your specific game‚Äîone that could only be unlocked
      by your specific genes, personality, values, skills, and life experiences.
      The hole in the Universe that only <em>you</em> can fill. I encourage you
      to experiment boldly, to be surprised by emergence, and to learn
      voraciously to be the master of your experience.
    </p>
    <p>That is your move.</p>
    <p><strong>The game is on.</strong></p>
